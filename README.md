# Decision tree

This is a project using data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets). The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease (Yes = 1, No = 0).

I applied in this project Decision trees in order to predict the value of the target variable (heart disease: Yes = 1, No = 0). Accuracy metrics are presented throughout the process along with graphical representations of trees. *Cost complexity pruning* was used in order to reduce the typical overfitting of Decision-trees learners, in this regard there is a detailed explanation on how to fine tune the nonnegative tuning parameter $\alpha$.

The code for this project can be located here: [Decision_Trees](decision_tree.ipynb), and the data is under the [data](data) folder. The [dot files](dot&#32;files) contains a graph description representation of the trees in dot format, while the [figures](figures) folder contain the same figures under png format.
